# The numpy.random Package

## Purpose
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and ancillary files in which some aspects and features of the [numpy.random](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) Python package are discussed and demonstrated in part fulfillment of requirements for the *Programming for Data Analysis* module of the HDipSc in Computing in Data Analytics at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT).

## Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:
- [README.md](https://github.com/fod/numpy-random/blob/main/README.md) -- This file.
- [.gitignore](https://github.com/fod/numpy-random/blob/main/.gitignore) -- The repository's git ignore file.
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/fod/numpy-random/blob/main/requirements.txt) -- Library names and version numbers required to reproduce the Python environment in which the notebook was created.
- [numpy-random.ipynb](https://github.com/fod/numpy-random/blob/main/numpy-random.ipynb) -- The Jupyter notebook containing the discussion and demonstration of `numpy.random`.

## Requirements
The full environment used to complete this project can be duplicated using [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and Python version 3.9.7. However, for convenience, a list of the packages that were explicitly installed is given below. These can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/api/index.html), or any other Python package manager that packages them.

- Python 3.9.7
- faker==9.8.2
- jupyterlab==3.2.4
- matplotlib==3.5.0
- scipy==1.7.2
- tabulate==0.8.9

## Viewing the numpy-random Jupyter notebook

The notebook can be downloaded and viewed and interacted with anywhere there is a Jupyter server and a suitable Python environment. Alternatively [Github will do a reasonable job of rendering it](numpy-random.ipynb). 

A static version of the notebook can also be viewed via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) by clicking on the button:

Finally, an interactive copy of the notebook can be viewed and altered, if desired, using [binder](https://mybinder.org/), by clicking on the binder button:
